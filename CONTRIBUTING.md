# Contributing


**Thank you for coming!**

We welcome everyone to Renkon and provide this guide for anyone interested in contributing.


### Report Bugs

Please make sure the bug is not already reported by searching existing [issues].

If you're unable to find an existing issue addressing the problem, [open a new one][new-issue]. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.


### Suggest an Enhancement

Feel free to contact [@bok_][twitter] on Twitter, or [open a new issue][new-issue].


### Submit a Pull Request

Discuss your idea first, so that your changes have a good chance of being merged in.

Submit your pull request against the `main` branch.

Pull requests that include tests for modified and new functionalities, inline documentation, and relevant updates to the main README.md are merged faster, because you won't have to wait for somebody else to complete your contribution.
